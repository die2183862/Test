            <h2>Impacts</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Environmental impacts (ice melt, sea level rise)</h3>
                    The environmental impacts of climate change are widespread and accelerating. One of the most visible consequences is the rapid melting of ice in polar and glacial regions. Arctic sea ice extent has declined significantly over recent decades, and glaciers worldwide are retreating at unprecedented rates. This ice loss contributes directly to rising sea levels, which have increased by about 21â€“24 centimeters since 1880, with the rate nearly doubling since 2006 (NASA, 2023). Rising sea levels pose threats to coastal ecosystems, lead to more frequent and severe flooding, and contribute to the salinization of freshwater sources and agricultural lands (IPCC, 2021).
                </li>
                <li><h3>Human impacts (health, economy)</h3>
                    Climate change also has profound human impacts, affecting both health and the economy. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires. These events not only threaten lives and infrastructure but also strain public health systems. Heat-related illnesses, respiratory problems from poor air quality, and the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue are becoming more prevalent (World Health Organization [WHO], 2021). Economically, climate change disrupts agriculture, reduces labor productivity, and damages critical infrastructure. The cost of climate-related disasters is mounting globally, with low-income and marginalized communities bearing the brunt of the damage (EPA, 2023).
                </li>
                <li><h3>Global and regional case studies</h3>
                    Various case studies from around the world illustrate both global and regional consequences of climate change. For instance, in Bangladesh, rising sea levels and increased flooding have displaced communities and intensified poverty, demonstrating the vulnerability of low-lying nations (Climate Reality Project, 2020). In contrast, the Western United States has experienced increasingly severe droughts and wildfires, affecting water supplies and public safety (USGCRP, 2018). Meanwhile, in the Arctic region, Indigenous populations face cultural and subsistence disruptions due to melting permafrost and altered wildlife patterns (IPCC, 2021). These examples highlight the diverse and interconnected challenges posed by climate change, requiring both local adaptation and global cooperation.
