            <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Causes of climate change</h3>
                    Climate change is primarily driven by human activities that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. The most significant contributors are the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity, heating, and transportation. These processes release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂), the most prevalent human-emitted GHG. Other key sources include deforestation, which reduces the planet’s ability to absorb CO₂, and agriculture, which emits methane (CH₄) from livestock and rice paddies, as well as nitrous oxide (N₂O) from fertilized soils and industrial activities (NASA, 2023; IPCC, 2021).
                </li>
                <li><h3>How it works (greenhouse effect, emissions)</h3>
                    The mechanism driving climate change is the enhanced greenhouse effect. Naturally, greenhouse gases trap some of the Sun’s heat, maintaining Earth’s temperature within a habitable range. However, human-induced emissions have intensified this effect, causing more heat to be trapped in the atmosphere. This leads to global warming, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather patterns (EPA, 2023; NASA, 2023). CO₂, despite comprising a small percentage of the atmosphere, has a disproportionate impact on global temperatures due to its heat-trapping ability and long atmospheric lifespan.

                <li><h3>Common myths vs facts</h3>
                    There are several persistent myths about climate change that conflict with scientific consensus.<br><br><br>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Myths</th>
                            <th>Facts</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>A common myth is that climate change is purely a natural phenomenon.</td>
                            <td>While natural climate variability has always existed, the rapid pace and scale of current changes are unprecedented and clearly linked to human activity (IPCC, 2021).</td>
                        </tr><tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Another myth suggests that CO₂ levels are too low to make a difference.</td>
                            <td>Scientific evidence shows that even small increases in CO₂ can significantly affect global temperatures.</td>
                        </tr><tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Some claim that there is no consensus among scientists regarding climate change.</td>
                            <td>Numerous studies show that over 97% of climate scientists agree that it is real and largely caused by humans (Cook et al., 2016).</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table><br><br>
                    These facts highlight the importance of distinguishing scientifically supported information from misinformation.
